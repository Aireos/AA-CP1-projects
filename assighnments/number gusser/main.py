#Make code where program generates a number between 1 and 10 and tell the user if they got it right.

#it should first tell them what it is, then have programm randomly generate number, then it will tell them to guess a number one through ten and tell them if it is correct.

#need to import random, make random number generater and get eh number in int form of what they gussed

#Import random (for generater)
#print "number gusser game" at the top right as code starts
#Ask for their guess (set to guess varaible)
#using random, generate number 1-10 (set to number varaible)
#set that if guess == number: tell them that they were correct
#set else: tell them that they were incorrect

import random
print("Welcome to the number guessing game!")
